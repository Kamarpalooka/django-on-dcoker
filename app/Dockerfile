The Dockerfile defines an applicationâ€™s image content via one or more
build commands that configure that image. Once built, you can run the image in a container

This Dockerfile starts with a Python 3 parent image.
The parent image is modified by adding a new code directory.
The parent image is further modified by installing the Python requirements defined in the requirements.txt file.
